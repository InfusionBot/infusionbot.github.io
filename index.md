## Features

### Customizable Settings

Adjust the settings to fit all the needs of your server! You can select the channel to send welcome logs to, the welcome log message, the prefix of the bot for this server, and more…

### Reliable and High Quality

With our revolutionary infrastructure implementation, we’re proud to achieve absolute 100% uptime! (but still only 99.9% uptime when we upgrade the bot to a new version). This means that Welcome-Bot will always be online, and ready to relay messages between your server staff and users!

### Multi-purpose

We also give you a feature "Moderation" that hepls you to quickly ban, unban and kick users.

### Open Source

We are an open source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Welcome-Bot/welcome-bot). Don’t believe what we’ve said earlier? Check out the source code for yourself! This means the maximum level of transparency, so you’ll never have to worry about privacy concerns.
